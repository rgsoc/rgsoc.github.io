So here we are! We are so very proud of ourselves... It might be the hottest day of the year today, but here we are meeting up on our day off to do some coding!

Because we don't see each other a lot, the first two hours mainly were just talking. We have a lot of catching up to do. Telling each other about tutorials, project (Rails Girls Groningen & Eindhoven YAY!), conferences we'll be attending and of course our day jobs. 

Now we are about to get to work, we are going to review the Spree documentation. As soon as we get everything to work ;)

We'll keep you posted!

Love Victoria and Hester

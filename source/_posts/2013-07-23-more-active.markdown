Today we were planning on how to actually make our blog Team Unicorn more active, how to structure the posts and push our new layout (thanks to Hester!). On Friday Victoria will finally learn how to post on the blog!

We also had our first planning about Spree project (yay!) It will be very changelling but a lot of fun!! 
Soon we will make our baby steps into the project :)

More news coming soon, stay tuned!

Still with a low level of coffee in our systems, we started our Google hangout at 11:30am. At the beginning we didn’t know where to start or what to do, so we started with the Code School tutorial, Rails for Zombies. It was a lot of fun and learning!

We also took the picture for the newsletter of Rails Girls Summer of Code, and we aren’t sure yet what was more difficult if the coding or take a picture that we both like!

Our first day was a lot of fun, sharing, coding and a perfect start for the rest of the summer.
